# CLV_Analysis_Starbucks-Data

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis â€“ Starbucks Data**  
*Data Science & Product Management Insights for Customer-Centric Growth*

---

## Project Overview

This project estimates **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using simulated Starbucks transactional data. CLV quantifies the long-term revenue generated by customers, providing strategic insights to optimize acquisition, retention, and revenue growth.

The project combines cohort-based revenue analysis with discount impact evaluation to demonstrate how data science informs product and marketing decisions.

---

## Key Objectives

- Calculate historic CLV using transaction data  
- Evaluate how discounts affect sales and profitability  
- Segment customers by acquisition year (cohorts)  
- Track spending patterns and lifetime value over time  
- Provide actionable insights for product and marketing teams  

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Simulated Starbucks transaction dataset (`customer_sales.csv`)  
- ~8,000 sales transactions across multiple years  
- **Key fields:** `Order Date`, `Customer Name`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Region`, `Product Category`, `Feedback`  

---

## Analysis Workflow

- Data cleaning and missing value checks  
- Outlier detection with visual and statistical methods  
- Sales & profitability trends based on discount levels  
- Regression analysis to identify sales drivers  
- Customer cohort segmentation by acquisition year  
- Cumulative revenue calculation by cohort and customer age  
- Historic CLV curve generation and business interpretation  

---

## Key Findings

- Excessive discounts (>80%) erode profitability despite boosting sales  
- CLV varies significantly by customer acquisition year, indicating different retention and revenue patterns  
- Data-driven cohort insights enable targeted retention and upsell strategies  
- Historic CLV curves provide measurable benchmarks for customer acquisition ROI  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Statsmodels`  
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and visualization  
- Data visualization to clearly communicate trends and insights  

---

## Business Relevance

This project simulates real-world **Product Management and Data Science** collaboration to:

- Quantify long-term customer value for Starbucks  
- Optimize marketing spend based on measurable CLV  
- Inform product and retention decisions using cohort insights
